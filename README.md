# Hey Everyone!

# About Me

I am Logan Walsh, an aspiring Software Engineer studying a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Computer Science at the University of Auckland (UoA).

I am very enthusiastic to learn from more experienced developers and tutors. I am currently learning JavaScript and MongoDB through my E-Commerce store project, where I hope to include other features such as inventory management. I am doing this as I want to create something more than just a store, which allows for more control from the companies' perspective.

Outside of software development, I like to spend my free time playing video games and working on my fitness, both through sports and working out in the gym. I also love to travel, and hope that I will have plenty of opportunities to do so in the future, either for work or pleasure.
